# Robo_aranha
Personal Project, possibly used for TCC later on.

Development of the mechanical structure, as well as programming te logic, of a quadruped robot, with 3 micro servos per leg.

The code is written in C++;
The microcontroller currently used is Arduino Nano (ATMEGA328);
The IDE currently used is Atom.

The sensors present in the robot are expected to be:
 - IR distance measuring;
 - Accelerometer/Gyroscope MPU 6050;
 - Push buttons in the extremities of each leg;
 - Camera OV7670;
 - ESP-12E for Wi-Fi connection;
 - A buzzer... just for fun :)
